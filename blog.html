            <h2>Furniture that multi-tasks as well as you do</h2>
            <p>
              If your student apartment is verging on the small side, then you
              need your furniture to be flexible. Be clever with a sofa that
              easily converts into a bed, without compromising on your style.
              Pro tip: underbed storage boxes are perfect for hiding blankets,
              pillows and throws when they’re not needed.

            <h2>Outdoor style, indoor comfort</h2>
            <p>
              Bring activities outside and create a room-like space on your
              patio with a few tweaks. A gazebo or a parasol gives a cosy,
              enveloping feeling. Coupled with homey outdoor rugs and soft
              cushions, you can enjoy gatherings or just chill out in your
              outdoor living/dining room, all day long.
